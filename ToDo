To do for the modified Letter Sternberg
The new version will be a branch off of the original. 
There will also be a branch off of this where edits will take place to the modified task.


Create the settings file for this version of the task
Update the GUI to make this an option << Done
Keep the letters to exclude as: AEIOUCSVWXZ << Done
Load letters of : 1 3 5 7 9
Decide on a set of ITI for the MRI runs and save them.  Create at least three lists.

Make a condition so that load levels may not be consecutive in either direction.  <<< This involves more logic then I 
have the time to figure out.

i.e. 3 5 CANNOT occur and 5 3 cannot occur <<< TO DO. Currently a design might not be able to be made due to the number of letters.
<<< Restrictions to the trial order need to be made.
