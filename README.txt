The main program to run is the: RuniLSv4.m program. This will open up the GUI. In order to run it needs a Config file named:
iLS_Config.txt

In this file are two fields:
[Trigger]
5
[Location]
Montpelier

The Trigger field is the keyboard button that the program will use to start. This is what is expected from the MRI.
The Location filed is either:
Montpelier or Columbia.
This changes some of the defaults and the choice of ITIs to load up.
