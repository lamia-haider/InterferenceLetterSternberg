This program loads the iLS_Config.txt file when it first runs. Therefore, you may need to either edit this file for the computer that will be running the program on. Or "Save As" one of the included files with this name.

The main program to run is called:
RuniLSv4 
which is in the Code/Current folder.

You can also create a shortcut to the "bat" file:
Code/BatFiles/Run_iLS.bat
This will launch MatLab and run the program.
