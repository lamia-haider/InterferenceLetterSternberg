function varargout = RuniLS_ScanRuns(varargin)
% RUNILS_SCANRUNS MATLAB code for RuniLS_ScanRuns.fig
%      RUNILS_SCANRUNS, by itself, creates a new RUNILS_SCANRUNS or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = RUNILS_SCANRUNS returns the handle to a new RUNILS_SCANRUNS or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      RUNILS_SCANRUNS('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in RUNILS_SCANRUNS.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      RUNILS_SCANRUNS('Property','Value',...) creates a new RUNILS_SCANRUNS or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before RuniLS_ScanRuns_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to RuniLS_ScanRuns_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
